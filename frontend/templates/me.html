        <div id="textbox" style="font-size: 15px; padding-top: 0px !important;"><p>I'm a multi-disciplined web developer and audio engineer. I've been based out of Austin since graduating from UT in 2017.</p>

            <p>I've played many roles within the music industry throughout my career: producer, mixing engineer, studio engineer, composer, 
            performer, studio musician, live performer, etc. I've worked with artists from across the US, as well as internationally. 
            This work has exercised my ability to balance an intense attention to detail while maintaining the flexibility needed to 
            cultivate a creative and emotionally rich environment.</p>
            
            <p>In the last several years I have switched my professional focus to the intersection of ecology and data visualization. I am currently
            an Engineering Scientist Associate at the University of Texas' Applied Research Laboratories, where I operate as the sole full-stack 
            developer on a small team of developers in the Environmental Sciences Laboratory. I spend my professional time making visualization tools
            in the React framework, and focus my free time on small, ecologically based web projects⁠—check out my
            <a href="/spottedlanternfly">spotted lanternfly</a> project for an example.</p>
            
            <p>I'm currently looking for the best ways to utilize my multidisciplinary skills and to develop my abilities in the data world.</p>

            <p>If you have any ideas or you'd just like to chat, <a href="/contact">send me a message.</a></p>
