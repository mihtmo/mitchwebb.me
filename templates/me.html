        <div id="textbox" style="font-size: 15px; padding-top: 0px !important;"><p>I'm a multi-disciplined audio professional. I've been based out of Austin since graduating from UT in 2017.</p>

            <p>I've played many roles within the music industry throughout my career: producer, mixing engineer, studio engineer, composer, 
            performer, studio musician, live performer, etc. I've worked with artists from across the US, as well as internationally. 
            This work has exercised my ability to balance an intense attention to detail while maintaining the flexibility needed to 
            cultivate a creative and emotionally rich environment.</p>
            
            <p>More recently I've switched my professional focus to the intersection of the ecology and computer science worlds. I've been 
            focusing my time on honing skills in data analysis and visualization using Python, JavaScript, and SQL⁠⁠⁠—check out my
            <a href="https://www.mitchwebb.me/spottedlanternfly">spotted lanternfly</a> project for an example. I'm currently working with 
            UT's entomology collections to lead the creation of an audio database of native insects and to aid in developing a methodology 
            for training machine learning models on the vocalizations of individual species.</p>
            
            <p>I'm currently looking for the right position to utilize my multidisciplinary skills and to develop my abilities in the data world.</p>

            <p>If you have any ideas or you'd just like to chat, <a href="https://www.mitchwebb.me/contact">send me a message.</a></p>
